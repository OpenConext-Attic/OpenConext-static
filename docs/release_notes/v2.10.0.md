# SURFnet SURFconext v2.10.0 Release Notes #

The 'phpFederate Joins SURFconext' release.

Notable issues resolved with this release:
* BACKLOG-510: Improve decline consent window
* BACKLOG-543: fixed error with scrollbars in discovery screen
* BACKLOG-585: textual and style changes to "metadata and certificates" page
* Fixed bug for mobile where an application is added to the homescreen,
  not canceling the default action would lead to breaking out of the homescreen-app and opening a new window
  that would go off into the abyss. Tested with uSis app from Leiden (thanks Martin!)
* Added static images for the IdPs on the VM
